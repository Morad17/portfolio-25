          Hi I'm Morad, a frontend developer from the UK. Aesthetics,
          Application and Avant-garde are factors I consider most when designing
          projects.My tools of choice are primarilty React, Scss & Node, with
          others implemented based on the project. If you have a project in
          mind, or a killer idea send me a message!
